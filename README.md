 python projects

In our python courses we learned how python really add dynamic features to any website.
We learned about the process of abstraction, encapsulation, how to build  a phone book and how to create a website you can use track and transfer files manually and automatically. We also learned more about if and else statements and how to incorporate them in different websites to give not only the user options but to give parameters for our code. We focused a lot on Django by creating a hotel website allowing users to input different food options and create and delete within a database.
